Unless otherwise specified, all Kotlin code should be written for Kotlin Common and must not
reference any Java libraries.

Execute gradle tasks with arguments ":composeApp:cleanDesktopTest, :composeApp:desktopTest,
--tests, [replace with TestClassName]" to compile and test the code. Do not use "--no-daemon".
Gradle is slow, so you have to leave enough time for it.

The Kotlin command-line compiler is installed. You can use kotlinc to quickly test Kotlin code.
